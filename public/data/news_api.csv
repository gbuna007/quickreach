"Grab Loss Swells on Spending to Lure Drivers, Customers",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-03/grab-loss-swells-as-pandemic-hampers-ride-hailing-demand,Olivia Poh,,Quarterly revenue declines 44% at Singapore-based ride giant. Grab shares have plunged since SPAC deal completed in December.,"Grab Holdings Inc., Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing and delivery giant, reported a wider loss after the company spent more on incentives to lure drivers and customers as the pandemic eases. The Singapore-based company’s net loss almost doubled to $1.1 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, also hurt by non-cash interest costs and expenses related to its public listing, it said on Thursday. Analysts estimated a loss of $645 million on average. Revenue fell 44% to $122 million, affected by the incentives offered to users and drivers. Grab -- which counts SoftBank Group Corp. and Uber Technologies Inc. as its two biggest shareholders -- has struggled to gain a steady footing since it became a publicly listed company in the U.S. through a deal with a blank-check company in December. Its shares have lost about half their market value since, wiping more than $15 billion from its market capitalization.",3 March 2022,,bloomberg,
Responses to delivery riders missing the bigger picture — Edwin Goh,https://www.malaymail.com/news/what-you-think/2022/08/29/responses-to-delivery-riders-missing-the-bigger-picture-edwin-goh/25316,Edwin Goh,,"AUGUST 29 — In early August, a number of delivery riders under the banner of Food Delivery Blackout gathered at Grab hea...","AUGUST 29 — In early August, a number of delivery riders under the banner of Food Delivery Blackout gathered at Grab headquarters to submit a memorandum demanding better compensation and working conditions. At around the same time, Capital A (the parent company of AirAsia Super App and AirAsia Food) announced that it will offer formal jobs to an unspecified number of its delivery riders with a minimum of RM3,000 monthly salary and full-time benefits. A few days later, the Transport Minister remarked on mandatory licensing for delivery riders, drawing vehement criticism from delivery rider group Penghantar for potential over-regulation . The plight of delivery riders has gained much more exposure in recent years, a reflection of their role and importance in urban Malaysian life today. In tandem, the plight of delivery riders is also becoming increasingly important to political parties, with various representative groups attracting cross-partisan interest from Umno and PKR . Perhaps, as a result, the government via the Transport Ministry is giving representative groups space to share their concerns on delivery fares and social protection. All this attention is to the good. Nevertheless, the policy analysis and responses that have been proposed so far have been, in our view, rather disappointing. As pointed out in a recent article , there is no clear consensus amongst delivery riders themselves whether they want to be considered as formal employees — one of the ‘solutions’ that have been proposed. The bigger picture currently not being addressed, in our view, is the nature of gig work itself and how our policies on employment classifications and benefits need to evolve accordingly. Tackling the root problem Globally, gig workers are increasingly dissatisfied with their end of the bargain. And countries across the globe have taken differing policy approaches in attempting to provide some measure of labour protection and to ensure fairer labour terms. In Malaysia, gig workers lack rights, benefits and protections as they are legally designated as independent contractors. To a degree, the government has recognised their vulnerabilities; gig workers are specifically mentioned in the 2021 Economic Outlook Report and some forms of assistance have been introduced including work accident insurance by Socso, a voluntary retirement savings programme under EPF, a housing credit guarantee scheme , various digital reskilling programmes , a microfinance initiative and many more. But none of these addresses the nature of platform gig work which revolves around delivery fares , payment schedules , rating systems , not to mention general issues on social protection . It is increasingly evident that there is no way to ensure decent work for gig workers without clarifying their employment classification. If Malaysia intends to maintain the status quo of keeping them as independent contractors, a comprehensive universal safety net would be required to ensure adequate social protection for gig workers (and indeed, all workers). Without a universal safety net, labour laws and benefits that are designed with full-time formal employment in mind will exclude gig workers who do not meet the employment definition. Why not reclassify gig workers as formal employees with full-time benefits? This approach would be viable only if all gig workers work full — time with one particular gig platform. However, this is hardly the reality. Not all gig workers are the same . Our 2019 study found that gig workers were almost evenly distributed between full-timers and part-timers, and both types of gig workers view gig work as an important income source. Perhaps more importantly, the majority of gig workers according to our study have a strong preference for job flexibility. Reclassifying all gig workers as formal employees risks curtailing their job flexibility and may produce unintended consequences. As seen in Germany , Spain and most recently the Netherlands , some gig platforms have ceased country operations entirely after formal employment classification was imposed, rendering their business models unsustainable. The all-or-nothing approach of classifying gig workers either as independent contractors or formal employees carries risks from two extreme ends: on the one hand, classifying as independent contractors means leaving gig workers vulnerable to algorithms and working conditions that are highly influenced by gig platforms’ practices. On the other hand, classifying gig workers as formal employees would increase the cost of doing business without necessarily improving their working conditions or preserving their jobs. Policymakers need to develop a new employment classification. Our cross-country comparison of gig worker policies shows a few country experiences we can learn from and to this end, we suggest a new worker category known as a dependent contractor to capture the unique nature of gig work.

Coding Bootcamp Market Size to Grow by USD 1.20 billion with 39% Growth Contribution from APAC,"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coding-bootcamp-market-size-to-grow-by-usd-1-20-billion-with-39-growth-contribution-from-apac---17-000-technavio-reports-301605272.html",Technavio,,,"The latest market analysis report titled Coding Bootcamp Market Growth, Size, Trends, Analysis Report by Type, Application, Region and Segment Forecast 2022-2026 has been added to Technavio's catalog. The analysts at Technavio have categorized the global coding Bootcamp market as a part of the global education services market. Our report provides extensive information on the value chain analysis for the coding Bootcamp market, which vendors can leverage to gain a competitive advantage during the forecast period. The data available in our value chain analysis segment can help vendors drive costs and enhance customer services during the forecast period.Few of the primary growth drivers for this market are the Low cost of Bootcamps, Increase in student enrollments, and rise in regulatory factors, says a senior analyst for the consumer discretionary industry at Technavio. The short duration of training complemented with low-cost options ensure the cost-effectiveness of coding Bootcamps when compared with a proper formal education that includes four years of bachelor's degree in Computer Science (CS). Coding bootcamps provide various options for the students to finance the program such as self-financed or access to low-interest loans and vendors offer deferred payment options such as monthly installments and tuition deferral until the employment of the student and free training through scholarships. In addition, the increase in ready-to-work coding Bootcamp is one of the key coding Bootcamp market trends that is expected to impact the industry positively in the forecast period.  The Bootcamps provide people with the full set of skills needed to qualify for a junior developer. These types of Bootcamps are typically referred to as Zero to Sixty code schools and include intense training programs that are full-time and part-time training programs which will further accelerate the market growth. However, an increase in formal education is one of the key challenges hindering the coding Bootcamp market growth. The increase in number of institutions and universities that provide formal education, such as bachelor's and master's degrees in the field of Computer Science engineering has increased. The non-acceptance of Bootcamp qualified students by the employers in the majority of the emerging regions are further catering to the growth of the formal education sector, thereby suppressing the emergence of coding Bootcamps in these regions. The unfamiliarity of these camps among students is further hindering the growth of the market and fueling the growth of formal education-providing institutes. Formal education is the biggest substitute for the growth of the global coding Bootcamp market.",17 Aug 2022,,PRNewswire,
