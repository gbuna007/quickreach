A blue puff of smoke bloomed skyward from the top of the ridge, superheated sap boiled to vapor in an instant. It dispersed on the breeze so quickly I wondered whether I had imagined the lightning.I reached for the field glasses where they hung from a hook in the ceiling of the fire tower, an instinctual move made without looking away from the spot of the strike. I lifted the binoculars to my eyes, focused on the ridgeline. I waited. Remembered to breathe. Waited some more. Nothing amiss. Nothing new or different along the contour of the hill. Then it happened: the slightest rupture in the continuity of the view, a light white fog that ghosted the length of the tree and twisted through its branches, only to disperse again on the breeze. This smudge of smoke confirmed that I hadn’t been hallucinating — that indeed a bolt from the clouds had lit the tree on fire, and I had been witness to the genesis. When I first became a fire lookout, no one told me that the Gila National Forest was smack in the middle of a highly flammable swath of the American Southwest, although I would learn soon enough. At the time I didn’t care much about fire. I mostly marveled at the fact that I had stumbled into a paid writing retreat with beaucoup views. “We thought we were putting out fires when in fact we were only putting them off.” I set the binoculars aside, crouched behind the peephole of my Osborne Fire Finder, and waited for the smoke to puff again. When it did, I aimed the crosshairs through the viewfinder and noted the azimuth to the fraction of a degree. Confident I had pinned the fire within a single square mile on the map, I called the dispatcher with my report: lightning-struck snag, narrow column of light-colored smoke, compass direction from me expressed in degrees azimuth, location by township, range and section. The Silver Fire: named for nearby Silver Creek. The surrounding country had been starved of fire — every new smoke suppressed as quickly as possible — going back a hundred years, an astonishing feat of military technology and human hubris. We thought we were putting out fires when in fact we were only putting them off. If we are to properly manage the land, we need the humility to learn from how the land manages itself. This one appeared poised to go big and stay awhile. I knew the mountain would be unrecognizable by the time the fire ran out of fuel, and maybe that’s what it takes to realize that our attitudes toward the wild must be reformed — just like a forest’s rebirth after a deluge. All the ingredients for a conflagration were in place. For the sake of cattle forage and stability on the watershed and a pleasing view of dense green trees from a tourist highway and a dozen other excuses that taken together amounted to outmoded and contradictory dogma.The result was an overgrown, unhealthy patch of forest further stressed by climate change. Thousands of dead white fir trees, killed by beetles a decade earlier, sprinkled the surrounding hillsides, and fuel moisture in the living trees had been sapped by years of substandard snowpack and above-average temperatures. The weather forecast predicted the trifecta of hot, dry, windy conditions in the days ahead. All available smokejumpers had been dropped on two other fires earlier in the afternoon, so none were still on call for the initial attack. Despite being well outside the wilderness, the topography was too steep and thickly forested for helicopter landings, so the only option for suppression was to send an engine crew whose members would have to hike cross-country from the end of a bad dirt road, a trip that took four hours, drive time included. For two full days I had a grandstand seat as my colleagues performed their suppression efforts — first the ground crew scratching a containment line, then air tankers dropping fire-retardant slurry. The containment line didn’t hold because big conifers kept toppling and rolling downslope, starting new spot fires below the crew, who had no choice but to flee for their lives. I stayed in service with them past midnight that first night, scanning their radio traffic on the tactical channel, eavesdropping on their progress and offering a communication link if they needed one, but I was of no use to their doomed efforts. “The rules of that game had been written in a previous century, under conditions that no longer applied.” The next day’s repeated slurry drops didn’t hold because the fire had grown too hot, actively burning through the sundown hours when agency planes were forbidden to fly for safety reasons. They offered an impressive spectacle by daylight, two alternating bombers flying low over the ridge, first one, then the other, load-and-return from the aerial firebase all day long. The red-tinted mud unfurled in translucent streamers, dispersing into the treetops like a poison mist, but every drop of it — 50,000 gallons of slurry, plus another 30,000 of water — was for naught. It was one more run at the old game, putting out fires with emergency money in liquid form, but the rules of that game had been written in a previous century, under conditions that no longer applied. The order to evacuate came just after lunch on Day 3 I was told I had 45 minutes to grab the possessions dearest to me and lock up the facilities for a departure of indefinite duration. A helicopter would soon spool up to pluck me from the peak and deliver me to the trailhead, where my truck was parked directly in the path of the fire. Soon the distant buzz of the chopper made itself heard, a low percussive hum that gathered strength until it roared over the meadow. The grass bent beneath the force of the rotor like seaweed swaying in the tide. Two helitack personnel ducked out the side door and loaded my supplies, a perfunctory job, performed wordlessly. It was a humbling and even sort of sickening feeling to board the machine for the flight out. More than a hundred times I had come and gone from the mountain over the years, mostly under power of my own two legs, a few times by the legs of a horse.When we landed at the pass, I stepped from the chopper and removed my flight helmet to watch the smoke rise and spin like a cyclone to the south, a vortex of unimaginable heat. Ash fell like flakes of snow on the hood of my pickup truck, and the growl of the fire could be heard more than a mile away. I joined the Black Range district ranger and three firefighters standing on the edge of the paved overlook, none of us quite capable of articulating the awe we felt at what we saw and what it meant for a forest we knew well and loved. I reminded myself that the mountains had always known fire, were in fact born in a cataclysm of fire, during a great volcanic explosion in the Eocene Epoch, an event orders of magnitude more dazzling than even the most spectacular wildfire. Created in fire, the mountains would naturally succumb to it for renewal and rebirth. Today happened to be the day they did so. When its growth ceased, four weeks after it began, the Silver Fire had moved across 138,705 acres, or 214 square miles. My boss granted me permission to return to my mountain in the final week of July. “Don’t get too depressed up there,” he said. “Remember, a big fire is just the birthday for the next forest. It will be green again before long.” It was a peculiar hike in, that first time back. Much of the walk was lacking in living vegetation. It felt spooky to be so exposed in a place where the forest had once provided the shade of an intermittent canopy. Now there was no proper canopy, just a bare etching of black branches against a pale blue sky. On a trail I had hiked so often I could make my way along it in the dark, I felt as if I were having the inverse of a déjà vu experience — traveling through a familiar place made newly strange. “Landscapes we loved were being transformed on a scale that was hard to absorb; entire mountain ranges were burning up.” The view to the south, where the fire first got up and ran, encompassed a stunning tableau of destruction, a ten-thousand-acre patch of forest transformed into charcoal: a century of accumulated biomass reduced to blackened stalks overnight. It had the naked look of country whose soil structure might unravel with one hard rain. Many of us who lived in and cared about the American West felt that sense of mounting loss, felt it in our physical beings — our reason for living here rooted in the physical, after all, both the land’s and our own. We liked the look and feel and smell of the mountains, and we liked to test ourselves in them, hiking, skiing, rock climbing, horseback riding, fly fishing, elk hunting — you name it, there was something for everyone, and big chunks of public land on which to do it. But landscapes we loved were being transformed on a scale that was hard to absorb; entire mountain ranges were burning up. For a hundred years we mostly kept the scorch at bay. And just as we awoke to the rude fact of our mistake, the fires became bigger and more intense than any we had ever seen, even in places like the Gila, with a decadeslong history of aggressive burning, though not quite aggressive enough. Scorched earth was now the ground we inhabited in the forests of the American West. In the southern Black Range, the old, green forest lived only in remnants and memories, and some of the memories were mine. It was a sobering thought, the idea that my mind, if I lived another 40 years, might become one of the last repositories on earth of how certain stands of old growth looked and felt and smelled in a place once called “the wildest Wilderness in the West.” At first, I wondered whether the fire would deform my connection with the country — whether it would inflict a wound that would forever disfigure my passion for it. Instead, I found I loved it more than ever, indeed felt an obligation to continue my annual mountain-sitting retreat for as long as I felt physically able, years into the future I dared hope, in order to see what the place would become, what capability for resilience it possessed, if only we could leave it the hell alone and let it burn.

And the ensemble cast this time around includes new cast members Edward Norton, Janelle Monáe, Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr., Jessica Henwick, Madelyn Cline, Kate Hudson, and Dave Bautista. Craig has already spoken about how “very different” the sequel is <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/knives-out-2-daniel-craig-gives-update-sequel-compares-original.html/\">compared to the original <em>Knives Out</em></a>.</p> <h2 id=\"h-rian-johnson-explains-why-the-knives-out-2-title-pays-homage-to-the-beatles\">Rian Johnson explains why the ‘Knives Out 2’ title pays homage to the Beatles</h2> <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"798\" src=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rian-johnson-knives-out-2.jpg\" alt=\"rian johnson knives out\" class=\"wp-image-3150756\" srcset=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rian-johnson-knives-out-2.jpg 1200w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rian-johnson-knives-out-2.jpg?w=150&h=100 150w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rian-johnson-knives-out-2.jpg?w=640&h=426 640w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rian-johnson-knives-out-2.jpg?w=768&h=511 768w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rian-johnson-knives-out-2.jpg?w=1024&h=681 1024w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rian-johnson-knives-out-2.jpg?w=90&h=60 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><figcaption>Rian Johnson attends the “Knives Out” European Premiere during the 63rd BFI London Film Festival at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square on October 08, 2019 in London, England. | Dave J Hogan/Getty Images</figcaption></figure> <p>From its title, <em>Glass Onion </em>– which, presumably, bears the <em>A Knives Out Mystery</em> subtitle for marketing purposes – already sets itself apart. Even though Johnson never planned to title the film <em>Knives Out 2</em>, no one expected he would name the film after the Beatles’ 1968 single “Glass Onion.” The track comes from the band’s iconic self-titled release, more commonly referred to as “The White Album.” Johnson recently clarified on <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/glass-onion-knives-out-2-release-date-photos\">Netflix’s website</a> why he chose that title.</p> <p>“I’m always fishing for something fun that Blanc can grab onto as an overwrought metaphor that he can beat to death. This is all in plain sight from the very start. So the idea of glass came to me, something that’s clear. I’ll be very honest. I literally got out my iPhone and searched my music library with the word glass. ‘There’s got to be some good glass songs.’ I was like, ‘Oh, is it a glass fortress? Is it a glass castle? Is it a glass man?’ The first thing that came up, because I’m a huge Beatles fan, is ‘Glass Onion.'”</p> <p>Fans of the <em>Knives Out</em> will no doubt remember Benoit Blanc’s “doughnut within a doughnut” monologue emerged as one of the film’s most memorable moments. Perhaps the detective goes off on a similar investigative metaphor in the sequel. Fans will have to wait and see when <em>Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery</em> debuts on Netflix on December 23, 2022.</p> <h2 id=\"h-knives-out-3-is-happening-but-when-will-it-be-released\">‘Knives Out 3’ is happening, but when will it be released?</h2> <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Netflix cuts a deal for ‘Knives Out 2 & 3’ for $450M ?<br><br>Daniel Craig is returning<br><br>(via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Variety?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Variety</a> | <a href=\"https://t.co/pJ3zM8d4Fx\">https://t.co/pJ3zM8d4Fx</a>) <a href=\"https://t.co/d9nBxZ4MTb\">pic.twitter.com/d9nBxZ4MTb</a></p>— Fandom (@getFANDOM) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getFANDOM/status/1377368910240968706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 31, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> </div></figure> <p>For as long as Craig expressed his hesitation to continue playing <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/daniel-craig-felt-james-bond-everything-james-bond-wasnt-supposed.html/\">James Bond</a>, the actor seems eager to continue on as Benoit Blanc.

The multi-Grammy Award winning songstress is currently on tour promoting her eight studio album, KEYS II , with her latest (and most intimate) stop being Vancouver. Alicia took the stage to perform in front of thousands at the Rogers Arena, and even got up close and personal with the crowd as she sang her 2010 smash \"No One.\" One fan was so excited to see Keys that she grabbed the singer's face and kissed her on the cheek as she moved through the crowd. Although Alicia has yet to speak out about the smooch, fans quickly hopped on social media to come to her defense. \"GET ALICIA KEYS OUTTA THERE RIGHT NOW!!!\" one fan wrote. Another added, \"What possessed that white lady to grab Alicia Keys face & kiss her.\" Alicia Keys is getting love from every direction these days. Earlier this month (August 1), her husband Swizz Beatz took to social media to wish his wife a happy 12-year anniversary , writing, \"Today 12yrs ago I married my best friend. Every sec has been filled with love and adventures. The best part is we didn’t even start yet. Love you 4 life Queen.\" Just before their anniversary, the Verzuz creator pulled the ultimate romantic gesture , gifting his wife a 150 carat Egyptian Queen inspired necklace, just because. According to reports, the chain cost Swizz a reported $400K and comes loaded with baguettes around the main piece which were set in a brick formation to resemble the country's Great Pyramids. Though the couple's love has spanned over a decade, Alicia once revealed that Swizz wasn't even her type at first. \"Honestly, I didn't really like him that much,\" she shared. \"I thought he was too ostentatious.

The awareness campaign was launched by Public Safety Canada (PSC) under the country’s national strategy to combat human trafficking. It kicked off in Halifax in July, visiting Montreal, Thunder Bay, Winnipeg and Edmonton, before making its last three-day stop in Toronto on Aug. 29. Leticia Hernandez Frias, the manager of anti-human trafficking policy with PSC, says the CNE was strategically chosen as a tour stop. “We chose locations where we would have a big influx of people — young people particularly as they are most vulnerable to human trafficking,” she explained. “The vast majority of detected victims are women and girls, so this is a highly gendered crime as far as we know. And even more alarmingly one in four of them are under the age of 18.” The exhibit aims to dispel misconceptions and myths about what trafficking looks like in a country like Canada, so people can spot it more effectively. “Ninety-five per cent of Canadians confuse human smuggling with human trafficking and that means they’re looking for all of the wrong things,” said Julia Drydyk, the executive director of The Canadian Centre to End Human Trafficking, which operates the Canadian human trafficking hotline. “They’re looking for people that are being kidnapped, chained up and forced into the commercial sex industry … when really human trafficking in Canada looks far more like intimate partner violence.” There are four main differences between human smuggling and human trafficking: Human smuggling involves moving people across borders and is by nature, transnational. Human trafficking often happens within a country. People who are smuggled are usually free to do whatever they want once they have arrived at their destination country. Those who are trafficked have their freedoms severely curtailed and are forced into labour or sexual activities. With human smuggling, profits come from the fee associated with smuggling a person. In trafficking, profits are made by exploiting the victim. Human smuggling usually means the person involved has consented to being smuggled. People who are trafficked have either never given their consent, or their consent is meaningless given the trafficker’s exploitation.   “Traffickers look for individuals with vulnerabilities in their lives,” said Drydyk. “That could be problems at home, issues with their friends, maybe problems at school. They’ll love-bomb them, they’ll find out their greatest hopes, dreams and aspirations but then they’ll quickly take that away as a way to coerce and force them into the commercial sex industry, all for their own profit. “[This exhibit] is challenging people [to understand] human trafficking outside of smuggling, across borders, forcible confinement and kidnapping.” The exhibit at the CNE has five stations that inform people of the realities of human trafficking, including an interactive quiz component. As people answer the questions, facts and statistics are presented to help them understand the extent of the problem in Canada and how to recognize the signs of both sexual and labour trafficking. “We are looking for changes in behaviour, physical appearance and relationships with family and friends,” said Hernandez Frias. “For example, do they have any relationship that they won’t introduce to friends and family? Are they isolating from family and friends? Are they allowed to speak for themselves? Do they seem fearful, nervous, or tense? “For forced labour cases [we are looking] for signs of the individual being unpaid or paid very little and seeming to be treated poorly, working long or unusual hours, not allowed breaks or forced to live in poor conditions. Do their activities seem to be controlled by someone else? Are their travel documents controlled by someone else?” Drydyk adds they have seen an uptick in what she refers to as trafficking remotely in recent years. “As our youth are spending more time on their phones and social media, anecdotally, we also know that there’s an increase in luring, grooming and recruitment online,” she said. “We’ve also heard about an increase in online sexual activity, [like] web camming, and again, coercing individuals into that type of sexual activity for profit, often against their will, using physical threats, but also emotional control and psychological violence.” Hernandez Frias says due to the hidden nature of the crime and the reluctance of victims to come forward, it is difficult to determine the true scope of human trafficking in Canada. “In spite of that police services in Canada reported almost 3,000 incidents of human trafficking between 2010 and 2020. According to the latest numbers released by Statistics Canada, the large majority of human trafficking incidents were reported in urban centers, and one in five were reported in the census metropolitan area of Toronto,” she said. She says they hope the exhibit, which runs until Aug. 31, will encourage people to not only educate themselves about the rampant crime, but also encourage them to stay vigilant in their communities. “Human trafficking is a horrible crime, but we can all do our part by being informed and staying alert. This may be happening to you. It could be happening to someone you know, or who you have never met, but knowing the signs and what human trafficking looks like can help you make a difference,” she said. If you’re looking for help or suspect someone is being trafficked, you can contact the confidential Canadian Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-833-900-1010. If there is immediate danger, call 9-1-1.","pubDate":"2022-08-30 21:53:18","image_url":"https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2022/08/30/CNE-TRAFFICKING-EXHIBIT-scaled-1024x576.jpg","source_id":"citynews1130","country":["united states of america"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jennifer Lopez Says Love Inspires Her: ‘It Never Gets Old’","link":"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-love-inspires-her-it-never-gets-old.html/","keywords":["Celebrity","Entertainment","celebrity","Celebrity Relationships","Jennifer Lopez"],"creator":["Sheiresa Ngo"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jennifer Lopez gives fans a peek inside her personal life during a candid question and answer session.

She says it’s important to take care of yourself so you can take care of others.</p> <p>She also says after many years she realized she has to be OK on her own before she can be in a <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-says-she-struggled-with-sleeping-alone.html/\">healthy relationship</a>. “I feel like right now, I’m good no matter what,” says Lopez.</p> <p>During a fan Q &A for the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxFq7Huqvbc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ask Anything Chat</a>, Lopez says she loves to spend time with others, but she also likes to be alone. She cherishes time to engage in self-care. “Even though I love dancing and hanging out and I’m an energetic person, I actually love being home,” says Lopez.</p> <p>Since Lopez has a hectic schedule, she relishes her downtime. “I love staying home. I work a lot,” says Lopez. “I’m around a lot of people all the time. And to just be home with babies running around and doing nothing, it’s something that I really love to do.” Lopez says she doesn’t have much time for herself. Whenever she can grab time alone, she’s grateful. </p> <h2>Jennifer Lopez is inspired by love</h2> <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"> <div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jennifer Lopez Never Imagined ‘Beautiful’ Reunion with Ben Affleck\" width=\"925\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WwMDIu4p928?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> </div></figure> <p>Lopez says she’s inspired by many things. However, the one thing she is inspired by the most is love. “The thing that inspires me more than anything is love,” says Lopez during her Ask Anything Chat. “That’s probably why it’s the title of my album. It’s the most fascinating topic in the world. It never gets old. And I always feel like I’m learning.”</p> <p>Although love fuels Lopez, she says she has to be careful because she’s a romantic. She says when she was dating Alex Rodriguez, she had to remind herself to slow down because rushing is what led to her getting married so many times.  </p> <p>Lopez says she had to remember there was no rush to get married. “When we first got engaged, I was like, ‘Oh, we’re going to get married in a couple of months!’ Your old thinking comes right back and that hopeless romantic that made me get married three times came rushing back.”</p> <p>Lopez didn’t think it made sense to rush because she and Rodriguez had the rest of their lives to get married. <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-must-have-chocolate-chip-cookies-and-milk-before-bed-says-alex-rodriguez.html/\">J.Lo and A-rod</a> ended their engagement early 2021.</p> <h2>Our take</h2> <p>It’s great that Lopez still believes in love and marriage even after three divorces and broken engagements. Although she says she’s aware of her tendency to move too fast, she did move pretty fast with <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-reveals-how-paid-tribute-to-ben-affleck-with-wedding-dress.html/\">Ben Affleck</a> the second time around. They were engaged before, so they had time to get to know each other, but people change. Hopefully, this relationship will work out, and Lopez finds her happily ever after</p> <p>Follow Sheiresa Ngo on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SheiresaNgo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><strong>RELATED</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/what-jennifer-lopez-said-about-love-and-relationships.html/\">What Jennifer Lopez Said About Love and Relationships</a></p>","pubDate":"2022-08-30 21:47:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"cheatsheet","country":["united states of america"],"category":["entertainment"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Leeds come from behind to grab 1-1 draw at home to Everton","link":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/leeds-come-behind-grab-1-1-draw-home-everton-2910851","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"LEEDS, England :Leeds United's Luis Sinisterra cancelled out Anthony Gordon's first-half opener for Everton as the two sides drew 1-1 in a pulsating Premier League clash at Elland Road on Tuesday (Aug 30). Strongly linked with a switch to Chelsea, Gordon started and finished the move that led to the opening goal in the 17th minute, cutting in from the left before collecting Alex Iwobi's pass and slotting the ball through the legs of Illan Meslier. Leeds striker Rodrigo Moreno missed a golden opportunity to put his side level in the 22nd minute as Jack Harrison flashed the ball across the box, but the Spaniard failed to connect with the goal at his mercy. The 31-year-old left the field 10 minutes later having suffered a shoulder injury in a tangle with Everton keeper Jordan Pickford, and though Leeds continued to enjoy plenty of possession for the remainder of the half they struggled to break down a stubborn Everton defence. The home side poured on the pressure straight after the break and got the goal they deserved when Sinisterra, making his first Premier League start, rifled home a bouncing shot in the 55th minute after a number of near-misses. Demarai Gray thought he had put Everton back into the lead in the 66th minute but the goal was chalked off following a VAR review that found him to be offside. Both sides squandered a number of decent chances to add to their tally as the game ended in a draw that leaves Leeds fifth in the table on eight points while Everton, who are still without a win this season, climb to 15th spot on three points. Everton boss Frank Lampard said he was looking forward to having new arrival Neal Maupay, who signed from Brighton & Hove Albion on Aug 26, registered to play in time for Saturday's Merseyside derby. \"We're playing games the minute without a striker and out and out striker was such ... now we're getting a striker that can play the next game, and we'll get stronger,\" Lampard told BT Sport. Despite dropping points at home for the first time this season, Leeds players did not seem too disappointed following the draw. \"Obviously it wasn't the start that we wanted. But it's important that we're able to grind out results and at the minimum get a point out of that,\" Leeds midfielder Tyler Adams told BT Sport.","pubDate":"2022-08-30 21:24:15","image_url":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--lM7NwqLy--/c_fill%2Ch_900%2Cw_1600/fl_relative%2Cg_south_east%2Cl_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters%2Cw_0.1/f_auto%2Cq_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2022-08-30t212415z_1_lynxmpei7t0zk_rtroptp_3_soccer-england-lee-eve-report.jpg?itok=7NgqShGf","source_id":"channelnewsasia","country":["singapore"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Stylish woman' wanted in Polk County Walmart theft, sheriff's office says","link":"https://www.wfla.com/news/polk-county/stylish-woman-wanted-in-polk-county-walmart-theft-sheriffs-office-says/","keywords":["Polk County","Local News","Mobile","News","Top Stories"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Polk County deputies are looking for a woman who is believed to be involved in a theft at a Mulberry Walmart.","content":"MULBERRY, Fla.

Fleck came to be","link":"https://www.inforum.com/sports/college/how-the-odd-awkward-matchup-of-jerry-kill-vs-p-j-fleck-came-to-be","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Grab you popcorn, those pre- and postgame interactions at Huntington Bank Stadium might hold drama, even if it’s don’t-blink brief.","content":"If not for Jerry Kill, the Gophers football team’s season opener against New Mexico State on Thursday night would probably be as boring as the 2018 opener between the two teams. Four years ago, on that late August day, Antoine Winfield Jr. broke six tackles and frolicked 76 yards for a punt-return touchdown. It was the lone memorable moment in Minnesota’s runaway 48-10 victory. This year’s opener, on the field, is nowhere near last year’s opener against mighty Ohio State on national TV. Come Thursday, Minnesota is a whopping 36.5-point favorite against New Mexico State, a small, independent program that went 2-10 last season and lost 23-12 to a rebuilding Nevada its Week Zero opener on Saturday. Off the field, however, this year’s first game has one overarching storyline: Kill repeatedly talking smack about Gophers coach P.J. Fleck over the years. Then earlier this month, the former U coach wondered if he would even shake the current coach’s hand before the game. Fleck responded last week saying he has always shook the opposing coach’s hand and will look to do so again. Grab you popcorn, those pre- and postgame interactions at Huntington Bank Stadium might hold drama, even if it’s don’t-blink brief. ADVERTISEMENT But how did this game come about? Former Gophers Athletics Director Norwood Teague is to thank for this matchup — although neither he nor anyone could have foreseen the twists and turns to set up this awkward moment more than a decade later. The disgraced AD entered into the contract in 2009 with then-New Mexico State AD McKinley Boston, who held the same role at Minnesota from 1991-95. The deal, according to a data records request from the U athletics department, was amended in 2012 when Kill was in his second season at Minnesota and again in 2015 when he was in his final year at the U. The two-games series originally was set for Aug. 30, 2018 and Sept. 3, 2020, with NMSU to receive $800,000 after the first game, which went off without a hitch, and then a $250,000 payday after the second. In 2017, P.J. Fleck’s first season at the U, newer Gophers AD Mark Coyle and NMSU AD Mario Moccia moved the date of the second game in the series from 2020 to Thursday. Kill was hired by New Mexico State last November. This nonconference game has moved around as much as Kill has changed jobs. After stepping down at Minnesota due to health issues related to epileptic seizures in late October 2015, Kill became associate AD at Kansas State in 2016, offensive coordinator at Rutgers in 2017, interim and then full-time AD at Southern Illinois in 2018-19, assistant to the head coach at Virginia Tech in 2019 and assistant to the head coach and then interim head coach at Texas Christian in 2020-21. Moccia and Kill overlapped at Southern Illinois in the 2000s and Moccia hired Kill to resurrect a Aggies program that produced a 25-74 record in nine years under Doug Martin. ADVERTISEMENT Kill has his hands full this year. Starting quarterback Diego Pavia threw for 75 yards and three interceptions and also lost a fumble before backup Gavin Frakes took over against Nevada. Frances was better, throwing for 143 yards, one touchdown and a pick. New Mexico State’s defense allowed Nevada’s running backs to amass more than 200 yards on the ground and two touchdowns. The Wolf Pack were never really forced to pass. All this could be a recipe for a long, lopsided game against Minnesota on Thursday night. Two other pre-existing contracts with Power Five conference schools won’t do Kill’s team any favors later this season. The Aggies play at Wisconsin on Sept. 17 and at Missouri on Nov. 19. … Kill’s first home game at Minnesota came against New Mexico State in 2011. The 28-21 loss was overshadowed by Kill’s seizure on the sideline with 20 seconds left; he left the stadium in an ambulance. … New Mexico State’s current roster has one Minnesotan, former Hill-Murray athlete Rashad McKinley of St. Paul. The true freshman defensive back did not play against Nevada. Hill-Murray’s coach is Rob Reeves, who was the tight ends coach at Minnesota under Kill. ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.
