Strongly linked with a switch to Chelsea, Gordon started and finished the move that led to the opening goal in the 17th minute, cutting in from the left before collecting Alex Iwobi's pass and slotting the ball through the legs of Illan Meslier. Leeds striker Rodrigo Moreno missed a golden opportunity to put his side level in the 22nd minute as Jack Harrison flashed the ball across the box, but the Spaniard failed to connect with the goal at his mercy. The 31-year-old left the field 10 minutes later having suffered a shoulder injury in a tangle with Everton keeper Jordan Pickford, and though Leeds continued to enjoy plenty of possession for the remainder of the half they struggled to break down a stubborn Everton defence. The home side poured on the pressure straight after the break and got the goal they deserved when Sinisterra, making his first Premier League start, rifled home a bouncing shot in the 55th minute after a number of near-misses. Demarai Gray thought he had put Everton back into the lead in the 66th minute but the goal was chalked off following a VAR review that found him to be offside. Both sides squandered a number of decent chances to add to their tally as the game ended in a draw that leaves Leeds fifth in the table on eight points while Everton, who are still without a win this season, climb to 15th spot on three points. Everton boss Frank Lampard said he was looking forward to having new arrival Neal Maupay, who signed from Brighton & Hove Albion on Aug 26, registered to play in time for Saturday's Merseyside derby. \"We're playing games the minute without a striker and out and out striker was such ... now we're getting a striker that can play the next game, and we'll get stronger,\" Lampard told BT Sport. Despite dropping points at home for the first time this season, Leeds players did not seem too disappointed following the draw. \"Obviously it wasn't the start that we wanted. But it's important that we're able to grind out results and at the minimum get a point out of that,\" Leeds midfielder Tyler Adams told BT Sport.","pubDate":"2022-08-30 21:24:15","image_url":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--lM7NwqLy--/c_fill%2Ch_900%2Cw_1600/fl_relative%2Cg_south_east%2Cl_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters%2Cw_0.1/f_auto%2Cq_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2022-08-30t212415z_1_lynxmpei7t0zk_rtroptp_3_soccer-england-lee-eve-report.jpg?itok=7NgqShGf","source_id":"channelnewsasia","country":["singapore"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Easy Gamerscore: 15 quick completions from the latest Xbox sales","link":"https://www.trueachievements.com/n50948/quick-easy-achievements-xbox-sales","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Grab some quick and easy score for a discount","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-30 19:02:31","image_url":"https://www.trueachievements.com/customimages/carousel/122974.jpg","source_id":"trueachievements","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia","singapore","canada"],"category":["technology"],"language":"english"},{"title":"AGM Marketing Celebrates 2 Consecutive Years on The Inc 5000 List &amp; the 1st Anniversary of its State-of-the-Art World Headquarters in Largo, FL","link":"https://www.prnewswire.com:443/news-releases/agm-marketing-celebrates-2-consecutive-years-on-the-inc-5000-list--the-1st-anniversary-of-its-state-of-the-art-world-headquarters-in-largo-fl-301614305.html","keywords":["Electronic Commerce","Advertising","Banking & Financial Services","FIN","ECM","ADV"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Manuel Suarez's marketing agency, AGM - Attention Grabbing Media, helps clients grab social media attention on a massive scale.

All were masked, except a group of boys. When they got in, it made her nervous. \"They told me that from today, they don't have to wear a mask in the car anymore,\" Ms Tay, 43, said. \"The law changed. I learnt about it over the weekend but it doesn't change that I have elderly parents at home who are ill and cannot afford to get Covid-19.\" Monday is the first day of Singapore's change in mask mandate, which has made wearing indoors, including in taxis and private hire cars, optional. The rule change in taxis and private hire vehicles has been one of the more divisive, going by online chatter, given the confined space and relatively prolonged exposure. Where previously drivers could turn away those who are maskless, passengers now have the final say. On Monday, drivers interviewed said about 80 to 90 per cent of the passengers they drove in the morning remained masked. With time, they expect more and more passengers to do away with masks. There is worry that it will become increasingly uncomfortable for drivers to state their preference as it becomes more normalised. \"The law no longer states they have to. So I can't really tell them what to do,\" cabby Chew Yeow Tay, 57, said. \"Once more people are familiar with the new rule, it will become harder for us. All we can do is disinfect but it's not really of much use.\" Both Grab and Gojek sent out notifications informing users of the rule change, but did not directly address the issue as a potential source of conflict. Gojek said it still encourages passengers to wear a mask, especially if they feel unwell - following the Land Transport Authority's official advisory last week. Grab acknowledged the change, noting that \"it's official\" but \"if you'd prefer to keep your (mask on), please do so\". On its app, one of the reasons that passengers can select as a reason for cancelling trips is that the driver is not masked. As both drivers and passengers get used to the new arrangement, those interviewed said there should be an implicit agreement that the party who is not wearing a mask does so if the other is wearing one. This applies to both passenger and driver, said cabby Kasbari Marmijan, 73, who pulls up his mask from his chin if his passengers are wearing one. His chief concern is not Covid-19, but passenger complaints. \"Some people got Covid-19 last time and said they might have got it in my car,\" he added. He keeps a physical copy of his vaccination certificate in case passengers ask if he has been jabbed. Mr Krsna Tan, a realtor and musician, said he follows one rule when he takes taxis or private hire cars, which is to mask up when he feels unwell. \"I'm not worried about getting Covid-19 because I am young but I'm worried about passing it to others,\" the 33-year-old said. Asked if he would put a mask on if the driver asks, he replied: \"Of course, I don't want to offend people. I just don't like wearing a mask and am glad people finally have the option to do so.\" There have been many studies that show that masks are effective in helping to reduce and slow Covid-19 transmission. But with Singapore's vaccination rates up and virus numbers largely under control, health experts have said most of those who get infected now are much less likely to experience severe illness due to vaccination or immunity from natural infection. They have, however, cautioned that those who are older or immunocompromised should still continue wearing masks, especially in crowded indoor settings.","pubDate":"2022-08-29 09:09:07","image_url":"https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/rl580/public/AK_sgcar2_290822.jpg?itok=g4RWVIw5","source_id":"tnp","country":["singapore"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Responses to delivery riders missing the bigger picture — Edwin Goh","link":"https://www.malaymail.com/news/what-you-think/2022/08/29/responses-to-delivery-riders-missing-the-bigger-picture-edwin-goh/25316","keywords":["delivery riders","grab delivery","gig economy"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"AUGUST 29 — In early August, a number of delivery riders under the banner of Food Delivery Blackout gathered at Grab hea...","content":"AUGUST 29 — In early August, a number of delivery riders under the banner of Food Delivery Blackout gathered at Grab headquarters to submit a memorandum demanding better compensation and working conditions. At around the same time, Capital A (the parent company of AirAsia Super App and AirAsia Food) announced that it will offer formal jobs to an unspecified number of its delivery riders with a minimum of RM3,000 monthly salary and full-time benefits. A few days later, the Transport Minister remarked on mandatory licensing for delivery riders, drawing vehement criticism from delivery rider group Penghantar for potential over-regulation . The plight of delivery riders has gained much more exposure in recent years, a reflection of their role and importance in urban Malaysian life today. In tandem, the plight of delivery riders is also becoming increasingly important to political parties, with various representative groups attracting cross-partisan interest from Umno and PKR . Perhaps, as a result, the government via the Transport Ministry is giving representative groups space to share their concerns on delivery fares and social protection. All this attention is to the good. Nevertheless, the policy analysis and responses that have been proposed so far have been, in our view, rather disappointing. As pointed out in a recent article , there is no clear consensus amongst delivery riders themselves whether they want to be considered as formal employees — one of the ‘solutions’ that have been proposed. The bigger picture currently not being addressed, in our view, is the nature of gig work itself and how our policies on employment classifications and benefits need to evolve accordingly. Tackling the root problem Globally, gig workers are increasingly dissatisfied with their end of the bargain. And countries across the globe have taken differing policy approaches in attempting to provide some measure of labour protection and to ensure fairer labour terms. In Malaysia, gig workers lack rights, benefits and protections as they are legally designated as independent contractors. To a degree, the government has recognised their vulnerabilities; gig workers are specifically mentioned in the 2021 Economic Outlook Report and some forms of assistance have been introduced including work accident insurance by Socso, a voluntary retirement savings programme under EPF, a housing credit guarantee scheme , various digital reskilling programmes , a microfinance initiative and many more. But none of these addresses the nature of platform gig work which revolves around delivery fares , payment schedules , rating systems , not to mention general issues on social protection . It is increasingly evident that there is no way to ensure decent work for gig workers without clarifying their employment classification. If Malaysia intends to maintain the status quo of keeping them as independent contractors, a comprehensive universal safety net would be required to ensure adequate social protection for gig workers (and indeed, all workers). Without a universal safety net, labour laws and benefits that are designed with full-time formal employment in mind will exclude gig workers who do not meet the employment definition. Why not reclassify gig workers as formal employees with full-time benefits? This approach would be viable only if all gig workers work full — time with one particular gig platform. However, this is hardly the reality. Not all gig workers are the same . Our 2019 study found that gig workers were almost evenly distributed between full-timers and part-timers, and both types of gig workers view gig work as an important income source. Perhaps more importantly, the majority of gig workers according to our study have a strong preference for job flexibility. Reclassifying all gig workers as formal employees risks curtailing their job flexibility and may produce unintended consequences. As seen in Germany , Spain and most recently the Netherlands , some gig platforms have ceased country operations entirely after formal employment classification was imposed, rendering their business models unsustainable. The all-or-nothing approach of classifying gig workers either as independent contractors or formal employees carries risks from two extreme ends: on the one hand, classifying as independent contractors means leaving gig workers vulnerable to algorithms and working conditions that are highly influenced by gig platforms’ practices. On the other hand, classifying gig workers as formal employees would increase the cost of doing business without necessarily improving their working conditions or preserving their jobs. Policymakers need to develop a new employment classification. Our cross-country comparison of gig worker policies shows a few country experiences we can learn from and to this end, we suggest a new worker category known as a dependent contractor to capture the unique nature of gig work. This new classification would allow the government to prescribe labour provisions for gig workers based on the labour power dynamics inherent in gig platforms. Note: More on this, and on worker benefits in our current age of job informalisation, can be read in our Fair Work Act proposal. Regulatory sandbox needed to facilitate regulatory innovation We’ve seen what happens when significant policy decisions — such as imposing blanket full-time employment classification — are meted out on gig ecosystems. Customisation and evolution from our current policy paradigms are required to balance job flexibility with worker protection. Therefore, for a feasible duration, we fully support a policy environment of trialling and flexibility for regulators in developing a better employment classification for gig workers. As a way of navigating this uncharted policy territory, we propose the creation of a regulatory sandbox to negotiate and formalise the structure, scope and terms for a proposed National Employment Status Test, which would ultimately lead to an employment classification for gig workers that is fit for purpose. What is a regulatory sandbox? A regulatory sandbox refers to a controlled environment under regulatory supervision which is typically used for testing new products, services, business models and delivery mechanisms in the financial sector. We have seen similar initiatives undertaken in other countries to spur regulatory innovation for protecting gig workers. In Denmark, a gig platform Hilfr and Danish union 3F collaborated to test a new classification method that automatically recategorises qualified gig workers as employees with some employment benefits, and an opt-out option to remain self-employed. And in mid-2022, Uber and the Transport Workers Union signed a joint Statement of Principles to call for legislating an independent body for studying and reforming the rights and conditions of gig workers in the transportation and food delivery sectors. A local example would be the regulatory sandbox to provide a regulatory environment for financial technology established by Bank Negara Malaysia in 2016. We believe that the Ministry of Human Resources (MOHR) is well positioned to set up a regulatory sandbox for re-classifying gig workers, where novel regulatory approaches like the National Employment Status Test can be developed and tested. The government can spearhead the regulatory sandbox with the participation of key stakeholders to conduct studies and policy experiments within a set time. The shift away from formal full-time employment to flexible hour gig work marks a significant, perhaps enduring, change in contemporary work culture. Emerging labour trends, including flexible work, remote working and digital nomadism, are creating new challenges for labour laws that were formulated in the past prior to its existence. We have arrived at a policy juncture where the government must decide between two policy approaches: a wait-and-see strategy with incremental policy shifts, or a structured trial-and-error approach to seeking new regulatory innovations. We believe that the latter is a more progressive, forward-looking policy approach in embracing the future of work to ensure decent work for all. * Edwin Goh is a researcher under the ‘Safety Nets’ pillar from The Centre , a centrist think tank based in Kuala Lumpur.
